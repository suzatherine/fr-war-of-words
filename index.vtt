You have the power to decide to dive to

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.789
realize and recognize Ukraine's rich and

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.909
interesting culture. You ask us why been

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.389
cheerful? He has done no harm. But we

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:23.855
need to rethink the narrative,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.190
then which is political, and we must

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.350
reclaim our context and history with

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.975
words.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.120
It's Russia's war against Ukraine, not a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.540
conflict. 24th of February is when the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.240
full scale invasion began, not when the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.930
worst started. It's Ukraine, not the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.420
Ukraine. We are a country not a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.625
territorial fresh. Our capital is key if

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.675
not key.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.800
We are replacing Russian streets names

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.800
and monuments for Ukrainian Tolstoy for

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.560
less Ukraine. The steps can Pushkin for

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.110
the destruction can demand Franco and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.660
even as our libraries are bumped, and

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.440
our books are burned 178 new publishing

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.265
houses have been established in Ukraine

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.660
is writers like Victoria Melina

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.730
contemplate the power works.

[audio playing...]

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.120
I am a writer and I moved from fiction

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.930
to nonfiction. because war is a time to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.055
listen to people's stories.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.990
And it's not like there is a need to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.220
make things up. The reality is so much

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.835
more intense.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.290
I'm writing a book called War and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.290
justice diary, looking at women looking

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.820
at war and also telling my story of how

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.445
I turned into a war crimes researcher.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.330
Because when the full scale invasion

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.580
began, HFS searched for a new role. And

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.820
after a few months, I started to travel

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.105
across Ukraine, documenting war crimes.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.350
Mainly this work includes going into the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.900
affected areas finding witnesses,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.120
survivors, and recording their

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.955
testimonies.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.780
I recorded the testimonies of the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.185
parents for the dinner for cooling call

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.670
the well known poet and children's

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.660
writer. On March 24, he was taken from

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.540
his house in the ASEAN region, where he

00:02:51.565 --> 00:02:54.755
had stayed with his son volunteering.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.525
Since then, his family hadn't seen him.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.440
In November, we finally got a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.655
confirmation that he was one of those

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.410
whose bodies were discovered in the mass

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.765
grave.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.730
I found his war diary, the diary he had

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.410
written during the occupation of his

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.945
village.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.490
He had hidden it in the garden right

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.075
before his abduction.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.190
And when he hit it, He taught his father

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.730
when our guys come give it to them. He

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.270
didn't say if our guys come, he said

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.110
when he was completely sure that Ukraine

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.935
would prevail.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.660
This diary shows incredible resilience,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.360
faith and hope, because of her demeanor

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.640
as it were the description of birds

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.285
flying over his village.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.860
And from this, we can imagine that it's

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.110
already the second half of March in the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.235
spring is coming.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.500
Voldemort was invaded by the village. He

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.780
had already experienced searches of his

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.255
home threads had been taken and beaten.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.310
And still he writes those words, that it

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.740
seems to him that the birds are singing,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.010
and everything will be Ukraine, I

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.815
believe in victory.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.450
I met with him briefly. And you know, he

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.450
was always very active. He felt he

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.500
needed to be at my done in 2014. And

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.810
really, he was quite severely wonder

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.750
there. He wanted to make history and he

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.035
did make history.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.345
But of course it has come with a price.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.260
You know, for a long time I believe that

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.350
empathy is endless. Like how Shakespeare

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.330
wrote, love is endless. The more you

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.120
love, the more you have. But in fact,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.235
I've learned that it has some limits.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.600
Why should I feel empathy for Russians,

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.970
when I have to work as a war crimes

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.640
researcher, and I'm sitting in front of

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.395
parents who lost their child.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.700
I'm sure there will be reconciliation,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.020
just not now. From now, we need to make

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.750
space Finally, for Ukrainian writers,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.200
artists, composers, heroes. It's about

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.380
power bands. It's not a coincidence that

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.800
countries that are on word empires also

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.665
promote that they have great cultures.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.730
That's why it's very important to hear

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.000
different voices, it is time to let

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:54.035
Ukrainians speak

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.600
they give us Z and we give them control

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.470
Z or Command Z, controlled saw, balanced

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.580
by a clown cult of each personality, and

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.790
therefore have none. poems are quite

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.095
mute, complex, meaningless, empty.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.795
Because if the story then it's bullshit,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.735
because of allegory, then it's nonsense.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.040
Because if hyper bowl then at once, it's

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.010
a rocket and a bomb emoji, because if

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.885
understatement, then it never existed.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.480
I wrote in advance, as if it was word

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.180
under the bridge, from the first sound

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.935
to hear, to see from the first glance,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.175
to know on the first try.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.220
Until then, I won't accept God. Until

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.540
then, I won't accept glitches, fear

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.260
frosted the soul, scarred the flesh, if

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.690
the game is foul, choose to be the

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.375
rules.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.945

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.590

said we give them controls, or commands.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.630
